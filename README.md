# About

This is a clone of the Typesafe Activator [hello-slick-3.0](http://www.lightbend.com/activator/template/hello-slick-3.0) template which has been modified to use a MySQL database instead of the H2 database.

# Usage

Modify the database settings in `src/main/resources/application.conf` and then execute the following command in the terminal from inside the project directory:

```
activator run
```
